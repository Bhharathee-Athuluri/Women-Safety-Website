            <h2>Motive of this website: </h2>
            <p>
                History says that women were ill-treated. The Sati Pratha in the ancient times to the girl child
                abortion in the present scenario, women continue facing such violence. Not only this, heinous crimes
                against women such as rape, acid attack, dowry system, honor killing, domestic violence, etc., are still
                happening.
                <br><br>
                As we all know, womenâ€™s empowerment is the most crucial point for the overall development of a country.
                In India, women empowerment is needed more than ever. India is amongst the countries which are not safe
                for women. There are various reasons for this. Firstly, women in India are in danger of honor killings.
                Their family thinks its right to take their lives if they bring shame to the reputation of their legacy.
                Moreover, the education and freedom scenario is very regressive here.
                <br><br>
                Out of the total population, 50% of the population should consist of women. However, due to female
                foeticide practices, girl child numbers are decreasing sharply.
                So it is vital to ensure their safety. So to better equip women regarding their well-being and security,
                this website has been created.
                <br><br>
                The main motive of this website is to provide required help and information for women to enable to
                empower and protect themselves.

        <p> This website has been created as a part of "SITE FORGING" competition conducted as a part of
            <b> SAPTACIA </b> which is held under VRS ACM chapter on 03-07-2021 and 04-07-2021.

            I chose this theme for my website as I am quite intrigued with this topic. While making this website, I
            learned a lot of things such as some new HTML and CSS topics and a few self-defense strategies and
            techniques too. It is quite an enjoyable experience for me.
