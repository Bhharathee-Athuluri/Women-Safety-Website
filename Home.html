            <p>
                Violence against women (VAW), also known as gender-based violence[1] and sexual and
                gender-based violence (SGBV), are violent acts primarily or exclusively committed
                against women or girls. Such violence is often considered a form of hate crime,
                committed against women or girls specifically because they are female, and can take many forms.
                <br><br>
                Such violence may arise from a sense of entitlement, superiority, misogyny or
                similar attitudes in the perpetrator or his violent nature, especially against women.

            <p>
                The UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women states, "violence against women is
                a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women" and "violence against
                women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position
                compared
                with men."
                <br><br>
                Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the United Nations, declared in a 2006 report posted on the United
                Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) website:

            <p>
                According to an article in the Health and Human Rights Journal, regardless
                of many years of advocacy and involvement of many feminist activist organizations,
                the issue of violence against women still "remains one of the most pervasive forms
                of human rights violations worldwide". The violence against women can occur
                in both public and private spheres of life and at any time of their life span. Violence
                against women often keeps women from wholly contributing to social, economic, and
                political development of their communities. Many women are terrified by these
                threats of violence and this essentially influences their lives so that they are
                impeded to exercise their human rights.

                As we've seen from these statistics, it is quite clear that the violence against women
                has been going on for a really long time. It's time for all of us to come together to
                put an end to this. It's time for everyone of us to make sure that the women of our world
