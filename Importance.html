            Crimes against women are a blot on our conscience. The protection of women from all forms of abuse and
            oppression is now a national duty. The status of women in India needs the continuous attention of the
            government, civil society; all those who are role models must play an important role in shaping public
            opinion, thus aiding in the evolution of collective and combined efforts to ensure the safety, security
            and dignity of women of our country.
            Everyone of us should take active part in ensuring women's safety. All of us sholud stand together to
            fight violence against women.

        <h2>Why is Self-Defense Important?</h2>
        <p>
            Every day, either on social media or on Television, you are hearing about women being victimized. There are
            so many stories of women that are available and you can hear about sexual violence or a random attack by
            strangers as well as being abused in some way. The world is changing and becoming more unpredictable
            particularly for women. As such, self-defence training is one of the most needed and must for every woman’s
            to-do list. In the crime world, self-defence training is suggested, so that the women can resist any kind of
            sexual assault as well as random attacks.
            <br><br>
            Some more reasons to ensure why self-defense is important for women are mentioned below:
        </p>
        <ul style="text-align: justify;">
            <li>
                <b>Safety: </b>
                The primary importance of self-defence is for women to be able to protect themselves against
                anything that’s unacceptable in terms of social conduct. <br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Confidence: </b>
                There is nothing more empowering than having the confidence to analyse a dangerous situation and
                take actions to overcome them effectively. <br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Empowerment: </b>
                It empowers women to lead a healthy and fulfilling life by encouraging them to deal with stressful
                and dangerous situations independently.<br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Discipline: </b>
                It teaches discipline which transfers over to all other areas of life. It helps women be calmer,
                understanding, flexible, gain body and mind control, be more responsive than reactive, more observant,
                and achieve cognitive awareness.<br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Reduces Dependency: </b>
                Just because you’re a woman, you shouldn’t be asked to travel with a companion! That’s what learning
                self-defense does – it makes you independent, helping you protect yourself in every situation. <br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Health and Fitness: </b>
                Self-Defense programs are also a fun way of exercising and building a healthy body, thereby improving
                physical and mental health. <br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Reduces Discrimination/Sexism: </b>
                Crimes against women can be curbed in a significant way when women are empowered to fight back against
                any discrimination and sexism. <br>
            </li>
