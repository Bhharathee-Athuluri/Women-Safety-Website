                href="http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Full-Report-2018-National-Study-on-Sexual-Harassment-and-Assault.pdf">
                January 2018 survey
            </a>
            of 1,000 women nationwide, 81 percent reported experiencing
            some form of sexual harassment, assault, or both in their lifetime.Verbal harassment
            was the most common form, but 51 percent of women said they were touched or groped
            in an unwelcome way, while 27 percent of women survived sexual assault.

        <p>
            Even if you’ve personally never felt yourself in a situation that made you feel physically
            unsafe, having reassurance about your next steps (and what you can do to help yourself
            should the unfortunate circumstance ever happen) can make all the difference.

                study from the University of Oregon

            found that women who participated in a self-defense class felt they:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>had better safety strategies in place</li>
            <li>were more equipped to deal with strangers, and people they know, in the context of
                potential assault or abuse</li>
            <li>had more positive feelings about their bodies</li>

        <h2>Time for some Strategies:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS</h4>
                <p>
                    If something doesn't feel right, it probably isn't safe — that's the bottom
                    line. Many women have been conditioned to ignore the little voice that tells
                    them trouble is coming. Your instinct is the best detector of danger.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>PRACTICE TARGET DENIAL</h4>
                <p>
                    Don't make yourself an accessible target. The outcome of a battle is often
                    determined before the first blow is struck. When you have the opportunity
                    to escape from a situation before it turns bad, take it.
                    <br><br>
                    It isn't cowardly to do so; rather, it's a smart way to eliminate danger.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>PRESENT YOURSELF WITH CONFIDENCE</h4>
                <p>
                    Attackers search for women who appear frightened, confused or distracted.
                    They look for women who walk with their head down and their hands stuffed
                    in their pockets, or perhaps one who's overburdened with packages or
                    distracted by children.
                    <br><br>
                    By walking with confidence and awareness — looking around and keeping your
                    head up and shoulders back — you'll dramatically reduce the likelihood of
                    becoming a target in the first place.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>SET STRONG VERBAL BOUNDARIES</h4>
                <p>
                    Good verbal skills are an effective self-defense tool, one you're likely to
                    use more frequently and successfully than any physical technique.
                    <br><br>
                    Although an aggressive verbal confrontation can be terrifying, you have
                    to be strong enough to show the attacker he's picked the wrong victim.
                    The power of your voice alone can cause him to seek an easier target.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>MAINTAIN A NON-CONFRONTATIONAL STANCE</h4>
                <p>
                    In a self-defense situation, one of your secret weapons is the element
                    of surprise. Most predators feel confident that you won't defend yourself,
                    and you should capitalize on that misconception.
                    <br><br>
                    If it becomes necessary for you to strike, he probably won't be prepared for it.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>KEEP A SAFE DISTANCE</h4>
                <p>
                    Everyone has a comfort zone or personal space. When an aggressor enters that zone, you're
                    uncomfortable because you know you'd need that space if you had to fight back.
                    <br><br>
                    You should try to maintain approximately one to one-and-a-half arm lengths between yourself
                    and the aggressor. If he starts closing in, you need to use verbal boundaries. If he still
                    doesn't back off, it's time to get physical.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>USE THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE</h4>
                <p>
                    Most predators assume you cannot defend yourself. Therefore, you should take advantage of the
                    element of surprise. If you're engaged in a conversation, you have the opportunity to use verbal
                    skills and a non-confrontational stance to entice the aggressor into dropping his guard. If
                    you're grabbed from behind, you must respond immediately. In either case, putting up a fight can
                    surprise him and increase your chance of landing the first blow.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>KEEP YOUR TECHNIQUES SIMPLE</h4>
                <p>
                    One of the main effects of an adrenaline release is the loss of fine motor skills. That means
                    simple gestures such as unlacing your fingers or pulling your hands out of your pockets can
                    become much more challenging.
                    <br><br>
                    So, no matter which martial art you practice, learn techniques that are basic and stick with
                    them in a self-defense scenario.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>DON'T PANIC IF YOU'RE KNOCKED DOWN</h4>
                <p>
                    More often than not, women end up on the ground when they're assaulted. The good news is that most
                    assailants are not skilled ground fighters; they're bullies who are used to knocking women down and
                    forcing them to comply.
                    <br><br>
                    So, at such times try not to panic and use some simple and basic self-defense technique to escape.
                    Remember that many techniques such as thrust kicks, knee strikes, heel-palm strike and eye strike
                    work well on the ground. So use it to your advantage.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>FOLLOW THROUGH</h4>
                <p>
                    The fight isn't over until the threat no longer exists. Therefore, you must be 110-percent committed
                    to the battle. If you fight back and then pause, you give up the initial advantage you gained from
                    using the element of surprise.
                    <br><br>
                    Once your opponent knows you can fight, it becomes more difficult for you to prevail. To survive,
                    you must continue your barrage until it's safe to stop striking and escape.

            <li>Stay in well-lit areas. If you park during the daytime, consider what the area will look like when you
                return at night. Make sure there is ample lighting.</li>
            <li>It is handy to attach a whistle to your keychain to frighten potential attackers and get help quickly.
            </li>
            <li>Make sure your cell phone is charged for emergency calls.</li>
            <li>See who’s at the door before you open it. Look through a window or a keyhole to make sure it’s safe.
